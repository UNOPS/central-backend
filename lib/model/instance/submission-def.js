// SubmissionDefs, like FormDefs, track the actual concrete defs of
// each submission. They have a different structure, however. Rather than join
// through to a table of immutable XML data, they contain the data directly. This
// is mostly due to the difference that a Form's latest available Def may not
// actually be the desired canonical def, whereas we can safely make this
// assumption for (approved?) SubmissionDefs. This difference means that there
// is no need for a backreference from the Submission back to the current def,
// as with Form, which simplifies a lot of referential issues.
//
// XML data is stored directly upon the SubmissionDef as a result. One might
// imagine that given many submission defs that might be substantially similar
// or identical, this would result in a very large table in the database. For
// rationale here on why this isn't the case, please see the comments on the migration
// that created this table (20190520-01-add-form-defing).
//
// Finally, attachment information is store per submission def. The rationale
// is that different defs may have different attachments.

  // given a submission definition, creates the expected attachments as rows in the
  // database. if a files array is given (via multipart.any()) and the expected
  // file is present, it will be attached automatically.
  //
  // for unencrypted submissions, the submission xml must be analyzed: the strategy
  // is to stream all fields, and any time a field is encountered for which our schema
  // indicates the expectation of an attachment we create the record.
  //
  // for encrypted submissions, the operation is somewhat more straightforward: the
  // submission manifest directly lists a set of <media><file>{name}</></> xml records
  // so we can just read those up.
  //
  // in either case, we need to do the bit mentioned above about taking a files array
  // and doing the correct blobby+association work. but in the first case we have a
  // Stream[Text] and in the second we have Promise[Array[Text]] so we can't just merge
  // the promises back together because Stream[Promise[op]] !== Promise[Promise[op]].
  // so we make that little utility first.
  //
  // TODO: this method /creates/ all Blobs it finds in the database, but only /generates/
  // the SubmissionAttachment instances to be created. this is because our current habit
  // is to perform Audit logging only at the resource layer, so we want to ideally
  // return control over the submission attachment data to that level so it can formulate
  // efficient inserts for both the SubAtt and Audits tables. but of course, this new
  // asymmetry is not too pleasant either, and should be figured out.
